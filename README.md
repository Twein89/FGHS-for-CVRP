# FGHS-for-CVRP 和声搜索算法实现
firefly global-best harmony search for vehicle routing problem
A firefly global-best harmony search algorithm (FGHS)  is proposed for CVRP to solve some problems of harmony search, such as the search process easy falling into local optimum and natural number coding uneasy combining with other algorithms. The proposed algorithm uses a real-coded. The updated formula in firefly algorithm is introduced in the new solution generation process. The tone adjustment of harmony search algorithm is improved by biomimetic properties of firefly, so that the search not easy to fall into local optimal algorithm. The algorithm also proposes a harmony memory reset method, while the algorithm traps into a local optimum, based on chaotic disturbance system to increase the diversity of solutions in harmony memory to help the algorithm to escape from local optimum. At the same time the use of 2-opt local search to enhance the exploitation ability.
